# Pong!
🏓The classic game of PONG recreated in UNITY

>Pong is a table tennis–themed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally released in 1972.

_Pong is a simple 2D table tennis sports game, and there's no further possible description for it. That's all one could tell about its concept._

### Features
1. Normal Mode
> Normal Mode is the classic well known mode of Pong.

It has two options 1 Player mode and 2 Player mode.

- 1 Player where you play against the Computer
- 2 Player where you play against your Friend _(If you have any, which I doubt you do 🙂)_

2. Funsy Mode 
> Funsy Mode, which I also term as **_"lazy pong"_**. 

**_AKA MY GAME MODE_**. Just relax and watch ☺

***Disclaimer: I haven't used this site for remaking the game, everything I remade is whatever I remember playing as a kid. So there might be difference in design***
